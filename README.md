Relative layout
===============

A system for laying out objects relative to one another, and automatically resizing them to fit the stage. Inspired by the fact that [jgranick's layout library](https://github.com/jgranick/layout) does not contain any code to keep objects from overlapping.

Warning: This code will change significantly in future versions. Among other things, I want to convert the enums to full-fledged classes.
